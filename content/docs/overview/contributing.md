There are many ways to contribute to the Data Package standard. Here are a few:

- **Use the standard**: The best way to contribute is to use the standard in your projects and provide feedback on what works and what doesn't.

- **Spread the word**: Help us spread the word about the Data Package standard. The more people who know about it, the more people who can contribute.

- **Report issues**: If you find a bug or have a feature request, please report it in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/issues). There a few predefined issue templates to help you get started.

- **Participate in discussions**: Share your ideas and feedback in the [Data Package Discusions](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage/discussions). We use a voting system to prioritize issues and feature requests.
